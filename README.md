# Segment-Tree-Visualizer
This is a JAVA APP named Segment Tree Visualizer. For certain additional functions like Sum, Max, Min, and Xor, this software uses amazing animation to display the constructing representation of Segment Trees. In order to demonstrate how queries work on segment trees using animation, I have also added a query feature that accepts l and r integer values (indices between which queries must be processed; zero-based index). The highlighted nodes at the end of the query indicate that these/this nodes/this node is where the answer came from (of which query is called ie, min,max,sum,xor).
