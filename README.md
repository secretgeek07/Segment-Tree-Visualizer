# Segment-Tree-Visualizer
A Segment Tree is a binary tree that is build on top of an integer array, so that we can solve the Range Min/Max/Sum/Gcd query as well as any Range Update Query of this array in O(log N) time instead of O(N) time. Given an array V of N integer elements, we can build the corresponding  Segment Tree in O(N) time.
